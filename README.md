We want to use loops to keep track of the number of clients that visit Lawrenzo Dental Practice on a daily basis. In a bid to check how productive our staff are, we also wish to keep track of how many patients are treated on a daily basis and the number of doctors that show up at work daily and the number of positive or negative reviews we receive
