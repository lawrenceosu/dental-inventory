# dental-inventory
Keeping a good inventory is very good for any business. 
The basic concept of our program is to use loops to keep track of the number of patients that visit Lawrenzo Dental Practice on a daily basis. In a bid to check how productive our staff are, we also wish to keep track of how many patients are treated on a daily basis and the number of doctors that show up at work daily. We are also aware of how important reviews are for visibility and growth of the business thus we would like to track the number of patients who write a review after visiting our dental practice as well as the number of positive or negative reviews received.
